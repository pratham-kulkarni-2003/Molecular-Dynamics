# Molecular-Dynamics
Algorithms based on the simulations run by me using monte-carlo methods.

Multiple arrays have been used to store the motion of every particle in a 10*10*10 box.

Forces due to 'neighbours' majorly influence the trajectory of the particle.

We have defined the 'neighbours' such that they are equal to 2.5*sigma; where sigma is the distance at which leonard-jones potential is a minimum.
